Then add the cucumber, again keep it on the heat another couple minutes.Now just toss in your potatoes, add some water until they are almost completely covered. Throw in the rest of the spices; caraway, bay leaf, tomato paste, parsley, chili flakes and salt. Taste, add a little more if you need to. You can go pretty heavy on the paprika, but should be careful with the caraway, it's pretty intense.At this point you just cover the whole thing, and let it simmer for a while, until the potatoes are through. Check on  the water situation every now and again, the potatoes should be almost completely covered at all times.When the potatoes are through you can start the thickening process. I just dissolved one teaspoon of flour in a little bit of water (you don't just want to throw it in the gulasch, since the flour could form into little chunks) So just pour in your mixture, slowly (not everything at once!), let it simmer and wait to see how much it thickens, and then if still to watery, add more.I also took out a couple of the potatoes, mashed them, and put them back (just another way to make the whole thing less watery)",
